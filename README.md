# BACE1_inhibitor
β-secretase (BACE-1), aspartyl protease involved in the abnormal production of amyloid- β plaques in the brain. We developed classification-based machine learning models build on chemical descriptors and fingerprints to classify BACE-1 inhibitors.

## Libraries
RDkit, Mordred, Pandas, Sci-kit learn, Numpy, Scipy

## Requirements
Anaconda, jupyter notebook

## How to use this notebook?
If you wish to predict the activity based on Mordred dataset. Then you do not need to go anywhere else. Just enter the smiles and you will get the result.
For predicting activity based on fingerprint data. you first need to generate fingerprints from PaDEL descriptor, freely available at http://www.yapcwsoft.com/dd/padeldescriptor/. However, we will bring this to python itself in our next update.

Run the line 1, 2, and 3 of the notebook.
Depending on the requrement run the potion of remaining code.
